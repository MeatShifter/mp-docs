# MPOS - Chroot

MPOS uses the command from the arch-install-scripts package

    arch-chroot /$NEW_ROOT

The arch-install-scripts package is in most GNU/Linux Distribution package repositories.

We should be able to run

    sudo $PKG_MANGER_INSTALL_COMMAND arch-install-scripts

on most distributions and get the desired package.

 *MPOS* should have this package preinstalled. Try executing

    # arch-chroot /$PATH_TO_NEW_ROOT
