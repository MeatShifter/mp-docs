# MagicPuddle - Operating System

We cooked up an Operating System that can be customized for any task.
We use an Arch-based version of GNU/Linux for servers and workstations that don't require Windows for the host operating system. Most modern systems can dual boot Windows if needed, virtual solutions are available as well.

We offer customizations to make MPOS act, look, and feel similar across all platforms within the limitations of said platforms and or equipment.

##### *The Arch-based version is the recommended version, choose the one that best suits your needs*
