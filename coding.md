# Development

To "develop", is to create a clearer image of our idea. Think of an analog photograph. To replicate the burned-in image in the film, a dark room, and various materials would be used, "develop" your photos. An hour later you have a copy of the still image taken with an analog camera ready for pick from your local Pharmaceutical receptacle.

Developing with computers is similar, in that we use tools such as editors, IDEs, compilers, and more to create a "virtually" manipulatable rendering of manipulated electricity and electronic hardware controlled by alphanumeric based sequences (code) or "developed" software contained on physical computer storage devices, achieving a specific goal being able to repeat its task(s) efficiently and without errors. All wrapped in a nice little package... Yes like the ones from amazon.

We use text editors to edit or create code in the desired language(s).
