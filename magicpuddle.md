# MagicPuddle - FAQ

## What is the MagicPuddle?

The MagicPuddle is a place for all tasty things relative to human life as a "manically depressed robot", playing with "the master's" tools. With the upshot of learning something fun, useful, and shareable.

We try not to over-complicate things, by sticking to the script and not obfuscating where it's not needed.

***K.I.S.S - "Keep It Simple Stupid" for short.***

## Who is it for?

The MagicPuddle is for everyone.

Beginner to the advanced users. Learn new skills that are relative. Learn what you want, your way, right from our documentation. We try to make our documentation short, fun, and as readable as possible. Go down a curated list of the same "rabbit holes" we did.
